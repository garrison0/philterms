In psychology, a *modality* is [a medium of sensation, such as vision or hearing](https://dictionary.apa.org/modality). A [concept](/posts/concept/) is modal if it has the same [mental representation](/posts/mental-representation/) as sensation.

For example, you may perceive a cat by hearing, smelling, feeling, or seeing it. According to indirect realists, this sensory experience *represents* the cat. Perceiving the cat relates you to this representation.

The concept of CAT is *modal* if the mental representation of CAT is the same as this perceptual representation of the cat.

The concept of CAT is *amodal* if the mental representation of CAT is something *more* than this perceptual representation of the cat.

For example, consider a chiliagon. A chiliagon is a polygon with 1,000 sides.

<div class="caption"> 
  <img src="/uploads/chiliagon.png" style="filter: invert(1)" width="300px"/>
  <em> A picture of a chiliagon </em>
</div>

Chiliagons are perceptually identical to circles, but the concept of CHILIAGON is different from the concept of CIRCLE--a circle has no sides. Amodal theorists cite abstract ideas like chiliagons as evidence for amodal concepts.

Yet, you've probably learned about cats by hearing, smelling, feeling, or seeing cats; why should your concept of CAT be anything else?

Further, try to imagine a cat. When you imagine a cat, you probably create a picture of a cat in your head. You imagine *seeing* a cat. Modal theorists claim that when you imagine concepts, you run 'simulations' of perceptions. They cite fMRI research that associates imagining concepts with the activation of the brain's sensorimotor regions.
