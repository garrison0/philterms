*Content* comes from the Latin word "contentus" meaning "contained." A **mental content** is a *content* of a mental state; mental states contain mental contents. Your mental state is your state of mind. Your mental state may be:

* a belief
* a desire
* a thought
* a perception

And so on. Mental states represent the world with mental contents. For example, you may believe that the earth is flat. If you believe that the earth is flat, then the [meaning](/posts/meaning/) of 'the earth is flat' is the *mental content* of your belief that the earth is flat.

## Are mental states always mental representations?

No. In the philosophy of perception, a *direct realist* argues that we directly perceive the world. By contrast, an *indirect* or *representational* realist argues that we perceive the world through *mental representations.* Consider perceiving a banana. The direct realist argues that you perceive the banana because the banana is in your field of vision. You don't perceive the banana because you stand in relation to a *mental representation* of the banana with some *mental content*.
