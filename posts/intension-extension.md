The **intension** of a term is its meaning. Intension contrasts with **extension**. The extension of a term is whatever it picks out.

For example, Clark Kent and Superman pick out the same person, but these two sentences differ:

1. Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent is Clark Kent.
2. Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent is Superman.

Lois Lane trivially knows that Clark Kent is Clark Kent, but she doesn't know that Clark Kent is Superman. Despite being *co-extensive*, these two terms have different *meanings*. Similarly, consider these two sentences:

1. Shakespeare believes that water quenches his thirst.
2. Shakespeare believes that H2O quenches his thirst.

Assuming the year is 1600, (1) is probably true, but (2) is impossible, because the chemical formula for water doesn't exist yet.

These examples imply that something about a word's *sense* and something about a conversation's *context* matters when determining meaning. These examples also imply that some of our mental states, such as

* believing
* knowing
* fearing
* desiring

depend on *sense* or *context*.
