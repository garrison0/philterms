A quale is a quality or feeling of conscious experience. Some examples include:

* the taste of coffee
* the sound of a violin
* the look of a red vase
* the touch of a fuzzy blanket.

When you touch a fuzzy blanket, it feels like something. That *something* is the quale of touching a fuzzy blanket. Qualia is the plural form of quale.

Some argue that qualia aren’t reducible to physical facts—no knowledge of physics, chemistry, or biology could ever explain qualia. The [hard problem of consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-neuroscience/#HardProb) refers to the problem of explaining qualia. On this basis, some argue for [mind-body dualism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#MinBodHisDua).

Others disagree. They claim that, when you see red, you come to know a physical fact (such as the wavelengths of light in the room) in a different *sense*. You learn a new way of representing this fact; you could’ve learned this fact without consciously experiencing it. In order words, the [content](fill in here - article on mental content) of the conscious experience reduces to this fact. The different sense means nothing.
