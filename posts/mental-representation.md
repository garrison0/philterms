Mental representations are hypothetical objects in the mind that represent the world. Mental representations traditionally explain three related things:

### 1. Some (or all) mental states have [intentionality](/posts/intentionality/)

Intentionality begs for an explanation. A *representationalist* argues that, when you believe 'the earth is flat':

* your mental state is *belief*
* you, in your state of belief, relate to a mental representation
* the mental representation's [content](/posts/mental-content/) is that *the earth is flat*.

Your belief that 'the earth is flat' is *about* the earth because you're in relation to a mental representation whose content is that *the earth is flat*. Your relation to the mental representation explains the intentionality of your state of belief.

### 2. You can imagine

The ability to imagine a banana without directly perceiving a banana implies that the mind has a *stored representation* of bananas.

### 3. You can perceive illusions and hallucinations

An illusion is just a perception that's false. If you directly perceive reality instead of perceiving reality through mental representations, how could a perception be false?

Some philosophers work extensively with cognitive science research. These philosophers typically distinguish between a mental representation's [format](/posts/format/) and its [content](/posts/mental-content/). They use this distinction to argue about:

* the nature of [concepts](/posts/concept/)
* the nature of [qualia](/posts/qualia/)
* the existence of non-conceptual representations
* the difference between thinking and seeing
