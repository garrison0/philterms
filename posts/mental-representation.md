**Mental representations** are hypothetical objects in the mind that represent the world. Mental representations explain three related problems:

### 1. Why do some (or all) mental states have [intentionality](/posts/intentionality/)?

A *representationalist* argues that, when you believe 'the earth is flat':

* your mental state is *belief*
* you, in your state of belief, relate to a mental representation
* the mental representation's [content](/posts/mental-content/) is that *the earth is flat*.

Your belief that 'the earth is flat' is *about* the earth because you're in relation to a mental representation whose content is *the earth is flat*. A representationalist thinks that your belief's intentionality is a side effect of you having a mental representation with the same content as your belief.

### 2. How do you *imagine?*

The ability to imagine a banana without directly perceiving a banana implies that the mind has a stored *mental representation* of bananas.

### 3. Why do you perceive illusions and hallucinations?

An illusion is a perception that's false. Consider the following MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion:

</figure>

Notice the length of the two horizontal line segments. The line segment in the bottom figure looks longer than the line segment in the top figure. The line segments are actually the same length. 

Either you directly perceive reality or you indirectly perceive reality through *mental representations*. If you directly perceive reality, how could your perception of the line segments' lengths be false?

Some philosophers work extensively with cognitive science research. These philosophers typically distinguish between a mental representation's [format](/posts/format/) and its [content](/posts/mental-content/). They use this distinction to argue about:

* the nature of [concepts](/posts/concept/)
* the nature of [qualia](/posts/qualia/)
* the existence of non-conceptual representations
* the difference between thinking and seeing

Among other topics.

## Are mental states always mental representations?

No. In the philosophy of perception, a *direct realist* argues that we directly perceive the world. By contrast, an *indirect* or *representational* realist argues that we perceive the world through *mental representations.* Consider perceiving a banana. The direct realist argues that you perceive the banana because the banana is in your field of vision. You don't perceive the banana because you stand in relation to a *mental representation* of the banana with some *mental content*.
