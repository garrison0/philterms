Mental states can be *about* things. They *concern* or *refer to*:

* objects
* states of affairs
* ideas
* qualities

And so on. **Intentionality** refers to the *about-ness* of mental states. Consider a belief *B* = 'bananas are yellow.' *B* is about bananas. *B*'s intentionality refers to *B*'s property of being about bananas.

Representationalists reduce conscious experience to intentionality (construed as [mental representation](/posts/mental-representation/)). If this explanation is accurate, then consciousness has a [naturalistic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/) explanation.

John Searle's [Chinese Room Argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/#Inte) claims that computers can never have mental states with intentionality.
